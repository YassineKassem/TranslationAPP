This project is an English-to-German translation tool that combines a FastAPI backend with a React Native frontend built using Expo.  
-Backend: The backend is powered by FastAPI and uses Hugging Faceâ€™s Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de model to perform English-to-German translations. The backend provides a REST API endpoint that receives English text input and returns the German translation.
-Frontend: The React Native frontend allows users to input text in English and displays the translated German text. It features a clean and responsive design, including flag icons to represent language options, and provides a smooth user experience for translating on the go.
-Network Setup: This application is designed for local network testing, making it accessible from devices connected to the same network as the backend.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning models into mobile applications, aiming to provide quick and reliable translations between English and German.
